{"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":"For 240V AC at 10A, you have two main options:\n\n1. **Mechanical relay** - Like the Omron G5LE-1 (rated 10A/250VAC)\n   - Pros: Cheap, low on-resistance\n   - Cons: Audible click, contact wear over time\n\n2. **Solid State Relay (SSR)** - Like the Omron G3MB-202P\n   - Pros: Silent, no mechanical wear, faster switching\n   - Cons: More expensive, needs heatsink at high loads\n\nFor home heating control with infrequent switching, a mechanical relay is fine. For frequent switching or noise-sensitive applications, go SSR."}}
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"This is for a smart heating system that might switch a few times per day. The relay board will be in a cupboard so noise isn't an issue."}}
{"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":"For that use case, I'd recommend the mechanical relay approach. A few switches per day is nothing - mechanical relays are rated for millions of cycles.\n\nThe decision is to use the **Omron G5LE-1-E** which is specifically designed for AC loads and has:\n- 10A rating at 250VAC\n- 5V coil (easy to drive from Pi GPIO via transistor)\n- Good isolation between coil and contacts"}}
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"What about the flyback diode?"}}
{"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Essential! The relay coil is inductive, so when you turn it off, it creates a voltage spike that can damage your transistor or GPIO.\n\nAdd a flyback diode (like 1N4148) in reverse parallel across the coil:\n- Cathode to the positive coil terminal\n- Anode to the negative coil terminal\n\nThis clamps the spike to ~0.7V instead of potentially hundreds of volts."}}
